        You say you wander your \\
        own land \\
        but when I think about it \\
        I don't see how you can
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        You're aching, you're breaking\\
        and I can see the pain in your eyes\\
        says everbody's changing\\
        and I don't know why\\
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        \textbf{I estribillo}\\
        So little time\\
        try to understand that\\
        I'm\\
        trying to make a move\\
        just to stay in the game\\
        and try to stay awake and\\
        remember my name\\
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        \textbf{II estribillo}
        and try to stay awake and\\
        remember my name\\
        but everbody's changing\\
        and I don't feel the same\\
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        \textbf{Pre-estribillo}
        You're gone from here\\
        and soon you will\\
        disapper\\
        fading into beautiful\\
        light\\
    \end{center}

    \begin{center} 
        cause everybody's changing\\
        and I don't feel right\\
        repeat I estribillo
        repeat II estribillo
        Everybody's changing\\
        and I don't feel the same
    \end{center}
